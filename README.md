# Interview Scheduler
Interview Scheduler is a single page application built using React, which pulls data from a PostgreSQL database. 
A user can book an appointment by selecing a day through Monday to Friday, selecting an open spot, typing in their name, and selecting an interviewer from a list. The user can also edit or cancel their booked interviews. The functionality of the code is tested using Jest and Cypress.
